Vagrant Virtual Environment
===

中文文档参考: [中文版本](README-CN.md)

Start to write some projects via different languages recently. In order to keep the HOST machine clean and tidy, I decide to use Vagrant(virtuabox provider) as develop environment.

1. The first environment need to mention is Go language

Read [Golang Environment](go-workspace/README.md) for more detail.

2. The 2nd environment is nodejs

Read [NodeJS Environment](node-workspace/README.md) for more detail.
